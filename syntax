# 📘 `SYNTAX.md` — The Synergex Syntax Guide v1.0

> *"To model reality, we must speak its grammar."*

Synergex is a **universal systems of systems meta language (USSML)** — a formal, expressive, and transdisciplinary framework for modeling complex systems across all domains.

This document defines the **syntax, semantics, and structure** of Synergex v1.0.  
It is both a **reference manual** and a **foundation for tooling, AI interpretation, and education**.

---

## 🧱 1. Core Components

Synergex is built from three foundational elements:

| Element | Symbol | Purpose |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **System** | `⟦ ⟧` | Encapsulates any entity, process, or structure |
| **Interaction** | `→`, `⟷`, `∮` | Denotes flow, coupling, or feedback |
| **Semantic Kernel** | `◈_X` | Universal functional motif (invariant across domains) |

Together, they form a language of **relationships, dynamics, and emergence**.

---

## 🔤 2. System Declaration

All systems are enclosed in double square brackets.

### Syntax:
```synergex
⟦System Name⟧
⟦System Name∞⟧  # Open boundary (interacts with environment)
⟦Substrate:Function⟧  # Optional annotation
```

### Examples:
```synergex
⟦Climate System⟧
⟦Neural Network∞⟧
⟦Market:Regulation⟧
⟦Mind:Self-Model⟧
```

> ✅ Use `∞` to denote systems with undefined or dynamic boundaries.

## 🌐 6. Semantic Kernels (`◈`) – Universal Functional Motifs

Semantic Kernels are **invariant functional patterns** that recur across domains.

### Syntax:
```synergex
◈_KernelName
```

## 📜 11. Grammar Rules (Synergex Syntax Laws)

To ensure clarity and consistency, follow these **core grammar rules**:

1. **All expressions must begin and end with a system or kernel.**  
   ✅ `⟦A⟧ → ⟦B⟧`  
   ❌ `→ ⟦B⟧`

2. **Feedback loops must be closed:** `∮( ... → ... → ... )`  
   ✅ `∮(⟦Sensor⟧ → ⟦Processor⟧ → ⟦Actuator⟧ → ⟦Sensor⟧)`

3. **Emergence (`⊗`) requires irreducibility.**  
   Use only when the result is *qualitatively new*.

4. **Isomorphism (`≣`) must be justified by shared `◈`-kernel(s).**  
   ✅ `⟦A⟧ ≣ ⟦B⟧ via ◈_X`

5. **Recursive structures must be bounded.**  
   ✅ `⟦S⟧ ⊂ ⟦S₊₁⟧ ⊂ ⟦S₊₂⟧`

6. **Open boundaries (`∞`) require at least one external interaction.**  
   ✅ `⟦Cell∞⟧ → ⟦Environment⟧`

---

## 🧪 12. Example: Full System Model

```synergex
⟦Climate System∞⟧ → ⟦CO2 Rise⟧ → ⟦Temperature Gradient⟧
→ ⟦Glacial Melt⟧ → ⟦Sea Level Rise⟧ → ⟦Coastal Stress⟧ ∮ ⟦Adaptation Cost⟧
→ ∇⟦Policy Response⟧ ⊗ ⟦Public Awareness⟧ → ⟦Renewable Transition⟧

# Tipping Point
⟦Permafrost Thaw⟧ ↯ → ⟦Methane Burst⟧ → ∮ → ◈_Amplifier

# Isomorphism
⟦Carbon Tax⟧ ≣ ⟦Immune Response⟧ via ◈_Regulator
⟦Misinformation⟧ ≣ ⟦Pathogen⟧ via ◈_Replicator ⊗ ◈_Susceptible Host

# Goal
⟦Stable Climate⟧ ← ❤ ← ⟦Intergenerational Equity⟧ ← ⊂ ← ⟦Global Cooperation⟧
```

## 🛠️ 13. Tooling & Parsing

Synergex is designed to be:
- **Machine-readable**
- **Simulation-ready**
- **AI-generative**

Future parsers should support:
- AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generation
- Isomorphism detection (`≣`)
- Kernel-based pattern matching
- Feedback loop validation
- Semantic validation (`⊨`)
